Our mentor shared us a pdf file with various youtube links for us to understand pine script. These videos were essential for us to understand about this new language. I watched the video regarding Trading pinescript version 5 and "trading view strategy" which was a 3-hour seminar. It taught us about the different mathematical functions, logic functions and plotting functions available.
 Post this we were taught about varioius different indicators and excercises like EMA 21, SMA 21, MACD, bollinger bands. Different strategies and signals were also introduced and were allowed to backtest our own strategies.
Some significant strategies were as follows:

1)5 EMA strategy :-        Power Of Stocks
2)Inside Candel :-  Inside_Candel_strategy
3)Bollinger Band Strategy 
4)Monthly Candel strategy {Power Of Stock app- Free Course section}

I also backtested the strategies mentioned in the document in order to get a good grasp on the platform and as to how to make a good and profitbale strategy.
Backtesting the trading strategy was a crucial step for us because it provideed us valuable insights and helped me make more informed decisions.
