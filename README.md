Our mentor shared us a pdf file with various youtube links for us to understand pine script. These videos were essential for us to understand about this new language. I watched the video regarding Trading pinescript version 5 and "trading view strategy" which was a 3-hour seminar. It taught us about the different mathematical functions, logic functions and plotting functions available.
to start off various indicators were were introduced and i made myself comfortablke with the trading view platform
Following were some of the excercies :
1)Dead Cross Over =>
2)Find  “doji” in the chart by the indicator/script .
3)Find Inside candle signal
4)Alert on the terminal when the condition is true.
5)Your Own idea which you want to test (Share idea and results)
6)Intraday:-
           Long the stock if open “Gap-Up” and Short If “Gap Down”
           ( for Midcap stocks Mostly )

7)Swing Trade:-  Len = 14,21,60,90,120, Factor = 1.1, 1.03,1.06  .. 
                   Price <  { Len } day Max price  and Price > Min Price{len}* Factor 
                   
Post this we were taught about varioius different indicators and excercises like EMA 21, SMA 21, MACD, bollinger bands. Different strategies and signals were also introduced and were allowed to backtest our own strategies.
Some significant strategies were as follows:

1)5 EMA strategy :-        Power Of Stocks
2)Inside Candel :-  Inside_Candel_strategy
3)Bollinger Band Strategy 
4)Monthly Candel strategy 

Pine Script allowed us to create custom technical indicators and trading strategies tailored to their specific needs. We were able to combine various indicators and conditions to build unique and personalized trading approache. One of the best ways to check if our strategy was good was to bactest it with the help of loads of data of stock prices in the past years. Based on the assessments and the performace of these one could make the necessary changes and perfect our model or strategy. we set targets as to what the min risk reward and proft ratio must be in order to try and improve each strategy. 

I also backtested the strategies mentioned in the document in order to get a good grasp on the platform and as to how to make a good and profitbale strategy.
Backtesting the trading strategy was a crucial step for us because it provideed us valuable insights and helped me make more informed decisions. The visual backtesting environment makes it easier to analyze results and make improvements. 

Apart from the codes mentioned on this github repo i was always trying out new strategies and trying different combinations with indicators which are not uploaded here.
